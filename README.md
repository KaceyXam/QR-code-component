# 100 days of Web Design

## Day 7 - Tailwindcss

Today, I wanted to do something fairly simple, so I did a newbie level [Frontend Mentor]() project with Tailwind Css. The project I did was QR code component.

I will be using Tailwind again on a bigger project to see if I like it. This project was just too small for me to get a good uncerstanding on how Tailwind works.
